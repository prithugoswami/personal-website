   - It is primarily for agents to collaborate on long running tasks. A primary agent could leverage many agents to complete tasks.
   - This is useful because the primary agent doesn't have to polute it's context with other tasks that can be handled in a seperate "thread".
   - The primary agent is responsible to steer the conversation with the secondary agent to get the task done.
- [Why can't agents just be tools?](https://discuss.google.dev/t/agents-are-not-tools/192812)
    - It's because tools are mostly actions you perform and there's a start and an end to it and it's a concrete task with an output you expect to get quickly. Eg. Create a new resources, update a resource with id 123, read the resource with id 123, etc. Tools don't allow for multi-turn interactions, whereas a separate agent can follow up with quetsions, clarifications and alternatives to solve a task.
	- That being said you still can have an agent as a tool for one-shot answers that don't require back and forth communication. Things like "translate this block of text to Spanish"
