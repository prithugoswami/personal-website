I am going to try to keep this as dense and precise as possible and only store
"usefull" knowledge. I am going keep this for things like "how was I supposed
to run a webdav server using rclone again"; well maybe not that, because that's
just a one line and belongs in the snippets.md file. But more like "how do I
setup weechat on android using an ssh tunnel and a weechat relay?". I can
imagine forgetting that. Or perhaps some sort of small tutorial or something?
