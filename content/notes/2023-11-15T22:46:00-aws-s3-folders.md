Although s3 has a flat structure&mdash;unlike a filesystem&mdash;it has a concept of "folders". Folders are 0-byte objects whose key
names end with a '/' When you create a folder from the s3 console it creates
this object automatically and you can manually create it using cli with an
object key ending in '/'
